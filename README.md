### Learning-Cpp
This whole repo's inspiration was h0mbre's Learning-C project.

I wont be writing a blog post about this project but the end goal is essentially the same

Write a piece of malware/rookit based on w0rm.cpp - http://harmony.haxors.com

It is probably going to take a few months before I'm able to get a decent grasp on malware development so this repository is a reminder to myself as well
